# Celtic Football data review

(https://celticdash.herokuapp.com)


 
 
 
####  One of my hobbies is that I enjoy making up Celtic quiz for my friends and 
#### family. The majority of the information can be found on Wikipedia and other
#### football websites. I decided that I wanted to pull all the data together into
#### one place. 
#### I cleaned up the data and placed it into an excel spreadsheed and then into CSV 
#### format
#### I want to work with Celtic Football club data that could be found on Wki pedia
#### Basically reformed the data on a excel spreadsheet moved it into CSV format


## Technology used

* Html
* Css/Bootstrap
* Mongo DB

* D3.JS
* DC.JS
* Crossfilter.JS


##Challenges

#### Planning and working with the data and technology to try and make the output as 
#### interesting as possible for the end user. 

#### If you make an error then I found it difficult to retrace my steps as the chart 
#### does not automatcially appear on the screen, which can be frustrating at times.

#### Deploying to Heruko, as I missed one digit on the edit confirmations screen which 
#### lead to hours of lost time. 

#### Keep track of the all the ndx.dimension names as it get confusing at time

#### Making sure that the json and on the celticdashboard.py and graph.js were linking correctly
#### together
